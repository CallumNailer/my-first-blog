            <h5 id="date">March 2020 - Present</h5>
            <h4 id="role"><b>General Assisstant, Poundstretchers</b></h4>
            <p id="role_desc">I got this job during the Covid-19 pandemic as a way to try and help the community in some way during these tough times, rather than being unproductive in my own home. Over the period of the lockdown, I worked as many hours as they would give me. On my second week I was chosen as the best of the new employees and was asked to go to a separate store to help as they were low on staff.</p>

            <h5 id="date">September 2018 - March 2020</h5>
            <h4 id="role"><b>Care Co-ordinator, Provide</b></h4>
            <p id="role_desc">At Provide I was responsible for doing the admin for referrals that we received from GP’s and doctors for patients. When I joined, I had to learn a completely new (to me) and complex piece of software called Systmone. The people who were training me left at the end of my first week, so I made sure that I learnt everything I could from them before they left so that I could do my job well when they did.</p>

            <h4 id="role"><b>Clubhouse Staff, Equity</b></h4>
            <p id="role_desc">During my gap year, I worked in a ski hotel in France where we would take big groups of school children and accommodate them for a week, providing them with food and drink, skiing equipment, and entertainment. I was responsible for cleaning rooms to a high standard in a short space of time – sometimes we had only a few hours to complete every room in the hotel. Also, in the evenings I had to serve food to our guests and be able to quickly clean and relay tables ready for later sit-downs.</p>

            <h4 id="role"><b>Front of House staff, The Green Room Restraunt</b></h4>
            <p id="role_desc">I worked here during my time at college to save up money so that I could go travelling before university. Whilst there I gained confidence whilst serving customers, was able to effectively remember and prioritize all the tasks I was given, and was also given greater responsibilities such as being in charge of larger parties. These larger parties ranged from 10-50 people and required my time management to be very good in order to make sure everyone had everything they needed.</p>

            <p>I did a ski season during my gap year. Prior to this I had never skied before so it was a big commitment for me as I would be doing it for 5 months. By the end of I had become a very competent skier and had even bought myself a pair of skis.</p>
            <p>Also, I like to try and keep fit by going to the gym and exercising. In recent times however, I have been doing home workouts whilst the gyms are closed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I have an interest in photography and enjoy taking pictures of scenery. Luckily, I have been to some amazing places to take pictures from, you can see a collection of my photos on the gallery page from my blog.</p>
